This project is part of the course Software Design in UIC.
The program was build using Eclipse with JDK-7. It is a simulation of a vehicle rental manager database. The user enters a command to do certain operations which include adding a vehicle, changing its availability, and deleting the database.
The program prompts the user for the necessary information to input along the way.

In this program I demonstrate the use of object oriented programming and polymorphism.
